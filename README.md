# Steamrolling

Our team collected data from The Graph using SushiSwap, found Etherium prices based off of AmountIn/AmountOut and AmountInUSD/AmountOutUSD. Using our adjusted data, we then created and tested a calibration model in order to find the best ann_sr score then applied that optimal model on historic etherium data.
