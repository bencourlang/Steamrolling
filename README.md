Our team collected data from The Graph using SushiSwap, found Etherium prices based off of AmountIn/AmountOut and AmountInUSD/AmountOutUSD. From that along with supplimentary data, we created an algorithmic machine learning model to assess the change in value of the coin pair in order to determine the optimal buy/sell pattern then simulate the model against historical data.
